If the boss' hp drops to 0, you won. If your own fighter runs out of hp, you lose. What you can do in every round: you can place 3 cards, and after you can attack with your fighter or cards. The field has 6 slots where you can place your cards. You cannot place more cards in a round then the limit or if you hadn't placed any cards at all, you will still have athe same amount of cards that you can place. "</string>
