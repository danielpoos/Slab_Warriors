If your own fighter runs out of hp, you lose. \nWhat you can do in every round: you can place 3 cards, and after that you can attack with your fighter or cards. \nThe field has 6 slots where you can place your cards. \nYou cannot place more cards in a round than the limit or if you hadn't placed any cards at all. \nYou will still have the same amount of cards that you can place."</string>
